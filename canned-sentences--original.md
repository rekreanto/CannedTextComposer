Dear customer

The design proposal is ready. Please, take a minute to review the images.

We hope that we understood your special instructions correctly. If not, please, contact us again.

The design changes that you have requested have been made. Please, take a minute to review the new images.

In order to achieve larger contacts areas, we have put a little bit of interproximal pressure onto the neighboring teeth. You may experience that the interproximal contact points are hard and may require some adjustment to fit the crown on the model.

In the Atlantis Web Order main menu - help section, you will find all support material available.

Even though you chose Process case for this order we thought it would be a good idea for you to take a look at the design proposal before we continue the production.

Unfortunately, we are not able to use the angulated screw access solution for this certain implant type/product.

Please, note the lack of space to the antagonist. The abutment is already as short as it can be without compromising the retention of the abutment.

Please, make sure that this is the correct occlusion and that you are content with the height of the abutment and/or crown.

We have added a little more pressure to achieve a better end result.

Due to the implants position, the abutment is now as angled as we can make it.

Due to the high implant placement, margins are now as low as we can make them.

The blank, the piece of material from which we mill the abutment, has a certain size/length and we cannot design or mill outside of this area.

Screw channel is visible on the buccal side, the esthetic result of that is challenging. Do you wish to change your order to a cement retained or custom base abutment instead?

Please, note that the screw access channel is through the aesthetic zone or functional cusp of the crown. Do you want to change your order to a custom base solution with an angulated screw access?

The screw access is as angled as possible.

We cannot guarantee the parallelism between the abutment and the prepared teeth/provided abutments/guide pin, but we did our best to achieve it.

For a more anatomical shaped abutment with the least compression to gingiva (by using concave emergence shape), please, consider Anatomical support option.

If you would like a more anatomical shaped abutment, please, consider choosing a wider Emergence width e.g. Contour Soft tissue or Full anatomical dimension.

We have noticed that you have made changes with 3D Editor. If you are satisfied with your changes, please, check the approval box below and the case will automatically go to manufacturing.

ATLANTIS Custombase with core file is only applicable for single tooth restorations, and cannot be used for splinted bridges, hence we cannot design these parallel. If you want parallel abutments for bridges, the regular ATLANTIS Abutments needs to be ordered.

If you have any questions or would like to change the design parameters, please, do not hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards
