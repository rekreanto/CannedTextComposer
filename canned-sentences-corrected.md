Dear customer 
#original 

The design proposal is ready. Please take a minute to review the images. 
#original 

We hope that we understood your special instructions correctly. If not, please contact us again. 
#original 

The design changes that you have requested have been made. Please take a minute to review the new images. 
#original 

In order to achieve larger contact areas, we have put a little bit of interproximal pressure onto the neighboring teeth. You may experience that the interproximal contact points are hard and may require some adjustment to fit the crown on the model. 
#original 

In the Atlantis Web Order main menu - help section, you will find all support material available. 
#original 

Even though you chose Process Case for this order we thought it would be a good idea for you to take a look at the design proposal before we continue the production. 
#original 

Unfortunately, we are not able to use the angulated screw access solution for this certain implant type/product. 
#original 

Please note the lack of space toward the antagonist. The abutment is already as short as it can be without compromising the retention of the abutment. 
#original 

Please make sure that this is the correct occlusion and that you are content with the height of the abutment and/or crown. 
#original 

We have added a little more pressure to achieve a better end result. 
#original 

Due to the implant's position, the abutment is now as angled as we can make it. 
#original 

Due to the high implant placement, margins are now as low as we can make them. 
#original 

The blank, the piece of material from which we mill the abutment, has a certain size/length and we cannot design or mill outside of this area. 
#original 

Screw channel is visible on the buccal side, the esthetic result of that is challenging. Do you wish to change your order to a cement retained or custom base abutment instead? 
#original 

Please note that the screw access channel is through the aesthetic zone or functional cusp of the crown. Do you want to change your order to a custom base solution with an angulated screw access? 
#original 

The screw access is as angled as possible. 
#original 

We cannot guarantee the parallelism between the abutment and the prepared teeth/provided abutments/guide pin, but we did our best to achieve it. 
#original 

For a more anatomical shaped abutment with the least compression to gingiva (by using concave emergence shape), please consider the Anatomical Support option. 
#original 

If you would like a more anatomical shaped abutment, please consider choosing a wider Emergence width e.g. Contour Soft tissue or Full anatomical dimension. 
#original 

We have noticed that you have made changes with 3D Editor. If you are satisfied with your changes, please check the approval box below and the case will automatically go to manufacturing. 
#original 

ATLANTIS Custom Base with core file is only applicable for single tooth restorations, and cannot be used for splinted bridges, hence we cannot design these parallel. If you want parallel abutments for bridges, the regular ATLANTIS Abutments needs to be ordered. 
#original 

If you have any questions or would like to change the design parameters, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards
